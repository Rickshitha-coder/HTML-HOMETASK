<title>TIRES OPTION FOR CAR</title>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Types of Car Tires</h1>
<p style="color:brown">The tires designed for this particular class of vehicles are generally engineered to deliver a smooth and quiet ride, reliable all-season traction, and long-lasting tread life.
Luxury vehicles that fall into the passenger touring category can find luxury tire options in both the all-season touring and grand-touring categories. While most cars in this segment will conform to these types of tires,
 some vehicles are modified for enhanced performance and will need more performance from their tires.</p>
<h4>Some common types of tires for these classes of vehicles include:</h4>
<p><b style="color:red">1. All-season tires</b>
<br>You can get an all-season touring tire that maximizes comfort. All-season tires create smooth driving conditions on the highway and have good traction for all seasons, hence the name. It will generally feature an asymmetrical tread pattern and circumferential grooves for wet weather grip.
If you live in a region with relatively mild winters, then all-season tires will likely do the trick, as they are technically built to handle both wet and dry roads year-round, including light snow. But if you’re looking for high traction and a good grip in serious snow and ice, you might want to look elsewhere. All-season tires are available in two standard classes: Touring tires and Passenger tires.
All-season touring tires — Lower noise and better handling
All-season passenger tires— Smoother ride and longer lasting</p>
<p><b style="color:red">2. Touring tires</b>
<br>Another type of tire that can work for this class of vehicles is a touring tire. Touring tires, also called Grand touring tires 
are designed to deliver a comfortable ride and reliable all-season traction, with the addition of more responsive handling. Touring tires tend to have increased speed ratings, which means the tires can endure higher speeds while still offering the driver security and control. In general, touring tires are geared towards performance.  
Performance sport and sedan vehicles generally require enhanced handling capabilities from their tires. 
They often want reasonable traction in a variety of conditions, but the focus leans more towards performance than comfort. Some touring sedan owners modify their vehicles and want a tire with greater performance capabilities. There are luxury options available in both the all-season performance and the summer performance segments.
A common challenge when buying tires is understanding the different types of tires, and which one will work best for you. The easiest way to group tires is to start with the type of your vehicle. After determining which tire types are possibilities for your vehicle, you can determine which type is best for you based on your driving needs.</p>
<p><b style="color:red">3. Summer tires</b>
<br>If you live in a warmer climate or need performance tires for warmer weather, summer tires could be a good fit for you. Summer tires are designed to work best in warm weather conditions and aren’t made for every season. They have a strong grip and responsive handling in various situations, such as dry or wet weather.
Summer tires generally feature solid contact patches, adequate circumferential grooves for hydroplaning resistance, and little to no sipping. They are ideal for performance vehicles in warmer climates.</p>
<p><b style="color:red">4. Performance tires</b>
<br>Though touring tires are geared more toward performance, they’re not to be confused with actual performance tires. Performance tires typically have higher speed ratings than touring tires but are also designed to support you in different weather conditions, especially wet weather.</p>
<p><b style="color:red">5. Track and Competition</b>
<br>Track and competition tires are similar to street performance tires in that they are designed to deliver the pinnacle of performance. Track and competition tires are rarely used for daily driving. They are engineered to provide constant road contact in dry conditions.
They differ from summer tires in their construction, which often features a high-tech body and sidewall reinforcements such as Kevlar or aramid. While these tires may be D.O.T. approved, they are designed for extreme performance and are generally used for amateur track days or professional competitions.</p>
